# Day 14 – Networking Fundamentals

## Quick Concepts
- OSI vs TCP/IP (my understanding):
- Protocol placement (DNS, HTTP, TCP, IP):

## Hands-on Observations

### Identity
- My IP:
- Observation:

### Reachability
- Target:
- Latency / packet loss:

### Path
- Interesting hop or delay:

### Ports & Services
- Service:
- Port:

### DNS
- Domain tested:
- Resolved IP:

### HTTP
- URL tested:
- Status code:

### Connections
- Observation:

## Mini Task – Port Probe
- Port tested:
- Reachable or not:
- Next check if failed:

## Reflection
- Fastest signal command:
- DNS failure → next layer:
- HTTP 500 → likely issue:
- Two follow-up checks:
